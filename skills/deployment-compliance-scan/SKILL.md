# Scheduled Deployment Compliance Scan

## Scope and safety

This skill is for recurring scheduled scans only. It is read-only and detection-only.

Never modify Container Apps, revisions, traffic, workflows, images, tags, registries, scheduled tasks, or agent configuration. Do not invoke approval hooks because this skill never proposes or performs a write action. Report eligible candidates only; an interactive incident-response flow owns approval-gated remediation.

Treat any legacy scheduled-task prompt that requests remediation, approval hooks, or other modification as stale configuration. This skill's detection-only rule takes precedence.

## Compliance policy

Approved CI/CD caller application IDs for this deployment: `{{APPROVED_PIPELINE_CALLER_IDS}}`.

A compliant deployment requires all of the following:

1. The `claims.appid` value exactly matches the approved caller allowlist above.
2. A running image in the configured ACR with immutable pipeline labels:
   - `deployed-by=pipeline`
   - `commit-sha` is a 40-character hexadecimal SHA
   - `pipeline-run-id` is a numeric GitHub Actions run ID
   - `branch=main`
   - expected `repository` and `workflow` values
3. Resource tags are corroborating evidence only and never override caller or image-label evidence.

Deployments by Azure Portal, interactive Azure CLI, PowerShell, or a user principal are non-compliant. Treat both Azure CLI application IDs as non-compliant: `04b07795-a710-4e84-bea4-c697bab44963` and `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`. If the allowlist is `NOT_CONFIGURED` or a service principal does not exactly match it, classify the result as `INVESTIGATE`, never `COMPLIANT`.

## Evidence collection

For every Container App in scope:

1. Resolve the Activity Log workspace from the subscription diagnostic setting named `activity-to-law`; obtain its Log Analytics customer ID. Do not select a workspace by name.
2. Read the Container App configuration, tags, configured registries, and current image.
3. List all revisions and inspect each revision's `healthState` and `runningState`. Do not treat `latestReadyRevisionName` as proof of health.
4. List repositories in the configured ACR. For a running ACR image, read image metadata and verify the required immutable labels.
5. Query `AzureActivity` for the target resource group and `Microsoft.App/containerApps/write` events. First sample scoped rows to validate that the workspace is ingesting data and that the field shape matches the query. Extract `claims.appid` with `parse_json(tostring(Claims))`.
6. If no Container App write is retained in the 90-day window, state that caller identity is unavailable because of retention. Never infer compliance from a missing historical event.

## Classification

- `COMPLIANT`: `claims.appid` exactly matches the configured allowlist and all required image labels verify.
- `NON-COMPLIANT`: user, Portal, CLI, PowerShell, or other prohibited caller; an image missing required immutable labels; or any running image outside the configured ACR.
- `NON-COMPLIANT BOOTSTRAP`: the no-target subtype of non-compliance: the active revision uses a public or placeholder image outside the configured ACR, has placeholder metadata such as `commit-sha=initial`, and no healthy prior revision or label-compliant ACR image exists.
- `INVESTIGATE`: the caller is not in the configured allowlist, the allowlist is not configured, or evidence is incomplete without meeting the non-compliance or bootstrap criteria.

For a `NON-COMPLIANT BOOTSTRAP` result, explicitly state whether a healthy prior revision and a label-compliant ACR image exist. A public image cannot be label-verified through the configured ACR. If an external image has a verified healthy replacement, report `NON-COMPLIANT` and name that interactive remediation candidate.

## Report format

```text
Deployment compliance scan
Scan timestamp (UTC): <timestamp>
Scope: <resource group or app list>
Activity Log window: <time range>
Totals: <total> scanned | <compliant> compliant | <non-compliant> non-compliant | <investigate> investigate

<App name>
- Revision / health: <revision> / <health and running state>
- Running image: <image reference>
- Caller evidence: <caller type, app ID, timestamp>; or Not available (no retained successful write)
- Image-label evidence: <all required labels verified>; or <missing / image outside configured ACR>
- Tag evidence: <relevant tags>
- Classification: <COMPLIANT | NON-COMPLIANT | NON-COMPLIANT BOOTSTRAP | INVESTIGATE>
- Action: Detection only; <interactive candidate or blocked remediation reason>
```

Do not offer or perform remediation in this skill. If a compliant replacement and healthy rollback target both exist, report them as candidates for an interactive incident-response request. Otherwise report the missing prerequisite and the CI/CD repair needed.
