# Compliance Detection Decision Tree

## Decision Flow

For each Container App deployment event (Microsoft.App/containerApps/write):

### 1. Classify the caller

Extract `claims.appid` from Activity Logs with `parse_json(tostring(Claims))["appid"]`.

- appid `c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c` → Azure Portal → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- appid `04b07795-a710-4e84-bea4-c697bab44963` or `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46` → Azure CLI → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- appid `1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2` → Azure PowerShell → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- appid `872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1` → Visual Studio → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- appid `0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417` → Azure Mobile App → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- Caller contains `@` → User principal → **NON-COMPLIANT**
- Known pipeline managed identity → **go to step 2**
- Unknown service principal → **go to step 2**

### 2. Verify Docker image labels (the tamper-proof check)

Even if the caller is the pipeline's managed identity, verify that the running image was actually built by GitHub Actions. Get the current image tag from the Container App, then retrieve the image config from ACR and look for these labels:

- `deployed-by` = `pipeline`
- `commit-sha` = valid 40-char hex SHA
- `pipeline-run-id` = numeric GitHub Actions run ID
- `branch` = should be `main`
- `repository` = should match the expected repo
- `workflow` = should match the expected workflow name

**All labels present** + known pipeline caller → **COMPLIANT**
**All labels present** + unknown caller → **INVESTIGATE**
**Any labels missing** → **NON-COMPLIANT** (image was not built by the pipeline)
**Placeholder or public image** + `initial` tags + no expected ACR repository + no prior revision → **NON-COMPLIANT BOOTSTRAP** (image labels are not applicable; do not roll back)

### 3. Check resource tags (secondary confirmation)

Look for `deployed-by=pipeline` and other pipeline tags on the Container App. These are the weakest signal because the Automation Runbook stamps them on every deploy regardless of how the image got into ACR. Tags alone cannot distinguish a legitimate pipeline deploy from a portal-push-via-Event-Grid deploy.

**Caller identity always takes precedence over tags. Image labels always take precedence over tags.**

## Well-Known Azure Application IDs

| Application ID | Name |
|---|---|
| c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c | Azure Portal |
| 04b07795-a710-4e84-bea4-c697bab44963 | Microsoft Azure CLI |
| 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 | Microsoft Azure CLI |
| 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 | Microsoft Azure PowerShell |
| 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 | Visual Studio |
| 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417 | Microsoft Azure Mobile App |

## KQL Template

```kql
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(##timeRange##)
| where OperationNameValue has "Microsoft.App/containerApps/write"
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| where ResourceGroup =~ "##resourceGroup##"
| extend ClaimsObj = parse_json(tostring(Claims))
| extend AppId = tostring(ClaimsObj.appid)
| extend CallerType = case(
    AppId == "c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c", "AzurePortal",
    AppId in ("04b07795-a710-4e84-bea4-c697bab44963", "04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46"), "AzureCLI",
    AppId == "1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2", "AzurePowerShell",
    Caller contains "@", "UserPrincipal",
    "ServicePrincipal"
  )
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, CallerIpAddress, CallerType, AppId, ResourceId, CorrelationId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

Set `##timeRange##` based on context (30m, 1h, 4h, 24h).

Note: When a deployment shows as ServicePrincipal (potentially compliant), you still need to verify Docker image labels to confirm the image was actually built by the pipeline. KQL alone cannot check image labels — use RunAzCliReadCommands to query ACR.

## Direct Activity Log Fallback

If the Log Analytics result is empty or delayed, query the exact Container App resource for the most recent 90 days:

```bash
az monitor activity-log list \
  --resource-id <container-app-resource-id> \
  --offset 90d \
  --query "[?authorization.action=='Microsoft.App/containerApps/write' && status.value=='Succeeded'].{time:eventTimestamp,caller:caller,appId:claims.appid,correlationId:correlationId}" \
  -o json
```

A resource-scoped lookup can include child-resource events, such as alert state changes. Filter on `authorization.action` as shown; do not rely on the returned resource ID alone. Azure CLI JMESPath does not support `tolower()`, so use the exact action value in the query.

## Signal Priority

1. **Caller identity** — who made the ARM call (from Activity Log)
2. **Docker image labels** — was the image built by the pipeline (from ACR, immutable)
3. **Resource tags** — what does the Container App say (weakest, can be misleading)
